# Real-Time-Image-Processing-on-Zynq-FPGA-PES-DHL-Project-
This project was developed as part of the PES-DHL (Digital Hardware Lab) course and implements a real-time image processing pipeline using VHDL on a Zynq-based FPGA platform. The system performs color filtering, region labeling, and feature extraction on video streams using a modular hardware design.
